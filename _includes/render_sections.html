			    <p>So, as we consider 2016 at Meedan, we have to give a nod to the fact that in the base-ten language we use to order our numeric system cycles of ten are a big deal.</p>
			    <p>Meedan was established as a 501(c)3 non-profit in March of 2006. We didn’t imagine at that time that our journey down the path of building open source tools for journalists and translators in the Middle East would lead us to a front row seat to the 2011 Arab uprisings. And, we didn’t imagine that the software for verification and fact-checking we began coding in 2011 in response to that experience would five years later collide with monitoring the US Presidential election and a global preoccupation with determining truth and credibility.</p>
			    <p>Ten years into Meedan we have found ourselves for a second time in the organization five years ahead of history.</p>
